# SIMON [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yfgjd8a0s918f7ge)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mrshridhara/simon) #

SIMON or SIMplified OperatioNs, is an Application Life-cycle Management (ALM) tool with Continuous delivery management support. It provides a simple yet definitive structure to a software development life cycle.

The idea is to build an ALM tool with minimum to no configuration which is functional out-of-the-box.

Note: This project is still in active development.
